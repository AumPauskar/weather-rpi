# Automatic watering system for garden

## Introduction

In today's fast-paced world, maintaining a flourishing garden can be a challenge. Busy schedules and unpredictable weather patterns often lead to underwatering or overwatering of plants, resulting in wilting, stunted growth, or even plant death. This is where an **automatic watering system** powered by the **Internet of Things (IoT)** comes in.

This project aims to develop an intelligent watering system that utilizes sensors and internet connectivity to deliver the right amount of water to the garden, **automatically**. This system will take the guesswork out of watering, ensuring the plants receive the optimal moisture level they need to thrive, regardless of the availability.

Here are some of the key benefits you can expect from this automatic watering system:

1. **Reduced water waste:** By watering only when necessary, the system helps conserve this precious resource.
2. **Improved plant health:** Consistent and controlled watering promotes healthy growth and prevents underwatering or overwatering stress.
3. **Convenience:** The system automates the watering process, freeing up the time and ensuring the plants are cared for even when you're away.
4. **Data-driven insights:** With the integration of IoT, the system can potentially collect data on soil moisture and adjust watering schedules based on real-time conditions.

This project will delve into the design, components, and functionalities of this automatic watering system, providing a roadmap for creating a smart and sustainable solution for the garden.

## Components and Interfacing

The core of the automatic watering system will consist of several key components working together to monitor and control the watering process. Here's a breakdown:

* **DHT-11 Sensor:** This sensor plays a crucial role by measuring the temperature and humidity levels surrounding the plants. This data can be valuable  for adjusting watering schedules based on environmental conditions. The DHT-11 is a digital sensor that communicates with the Raspberry Pi using a single data pin. You'll need to install appropriate libraries on the Raspberry Pi to interact with the sensor and read its readings.

* **Relay:** This component acts as a switch controlled by the Raspberry Pi. When the Raspberry Pi determines watering is needed, it sends a signal to the relay, which then activates the connected water pump, turning on the water flow. Relays typically require a driver circuit to handle the current needed to activate the coil within the relay. You'll need to choose a driver circuit compatible with the chosen relay and Raspberry Pi's capabilities.

* **Raspberry Pi:** This single-board computer serves as the brain of the system. It will be responsible for:
    * **Reading sensor data:** The Raspberry Pi will collect data from the DHT-11 sensor, including temperature and humidity readings. 
    * **Processing data:** Based on the sensor readings and pre-programmed watering rules, the Raspberry Pi will determine if watering is necessary.
    * **Controlling the relay:** The Raspberry Pi will send a control signal to the relay when watering is required, activating the water pump.
    * **Optional: Connectivity:** Client can potentially connect the Raspberry Pi to the internet to enable remote monitoring and control of the system. This can be achieved through Wi-Fi or ethernet connectivity.

**Interfacing the Components:**

Interfacing these components with the Raspberry Pi will involve some electrical connections and software configuration. Here's a general overview:

1. **Wiring:** 
    * Connect the DHT-11 sensor's power and data pins to the designated GPIO pins on the Raspberry Pi according to the sensor's datasheet and chosen library.
    * Connect the relay's control coil to the appropriate GPIO pin on the Raspberry Pi through the driver circuit. Ensure the driver circuit can handle the current requirements of the relay. 
    * Connect the water pump to the relay's output contacts and power source with appropriate safety measures.

2. **Software Configuration:**
    * Install the necessary libraries on the Raspberry Pi to interact with the DHT-11 sensor.
    * Write Python code to:
        * Read data from the DHT-11 sensor.
        * Define logic for determining when watering is needed (based on sensor readings and pre-set rules).
        * Control the relay based on the watering decision.

**Additional Considerations:**

* **Power Supply:** A separate power supply for the Raspberry Pi and potentially another for the water pump depending on its power requirements.
* **Enclosure:** Consider housing all the components in a weatherproof enclosure to protect them from the elements.

By effectively interfacing these components and writing the appropriate code, you'll create the core functionality of the automatic watering system. 

## UI/UX
## User Interface (UI) with React, Expo, and Fetch API

Since the project utilizes a Raspberry Pi for local control, a mobile application for remote monitoring and control can be a valuable addition. Here's how you can build a user interface (UI) using React with Expo and the Fetch API to interact with the watering system module:

**1. Setting Up the Project:**

* Start by creating a new React Native project using Expo CLI: `expo init theProjectName`
* Install any necessary dependencies like `axios` (a popular promise-based HTTP client) for making API requests: `expo install axios`

**2. Building the UI Components:**

* Design the UI using React components. You can leverage Expo's built-in UI components or explore third-party libraries like React Native Elements or NativeBase for a wider range of pre-built components.
* Consider incorporating elements like:
    * **Sensor Data Display:** Show real-time temperature and humidity readings received from the Raspberry Pi module.
    * **Watering Controls:** Include buttons or toggles to manually trigger watering or adjust watering schedules remotely.
    * **Watering Status:** Display the current status of the watering system (idle, watering, etc.).

**3. Fetching Data and Controlling the Module:**

* Implement the Fetch API or a library like Axios to make API requests to an endpoint exposed by the Raspberry Pi module. 
* This endpoint could potentially return sensor data and accept commands to control the watering system (e.g., start/stop watering).

**Here's a basic example using the Fetch API to fetch sensor data:**

```javascript
const fetchData = async () => {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('http://the_raspberry_pi_ip:the_port/api/data');
    const data = await response.json();
    // Update UI components with received sensor data (temperature, humidity)
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
    // Handle errors appropriately (e.g., display error message to user)
  }
};

// Call fetchData on component mount or at regular intervals
useEffect(() => {
  fetchData();
}, []);
```

**4. Sending Control Commands:**

Similarly, you can use the Fetch API or Axios to send commands to control the watering system. The specific endpoint and data format for these commands will depend on how you implement the API on the Raspberry Pi module.

```javascript
const startWatering = async () => {
  try {
    await fetch('http://the_raspberry_pi_ip:the_port/api/control', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
      body: JSON.stringify({ command: 'start_watering' }),
    });
    // Update UI to reflect watering started
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
    // Handle errors appropriately
  }
};
```

**5. Security Considerations:**

* When implementing the API on the Raspberry Pi, ensure proper authentication and authorization mechanisms are in place to prevent unauthorized access or control of the watering system.

By following these steps, a user-friendly mobile application that provides remote monitoring and control capabilities for the automatic watering system. Remember to adapt the code snippets to the specific API implementation on the Raspberry Pi module.
